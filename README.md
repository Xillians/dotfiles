This project is a collection for mac development setup

## Quickstart

First step is to  [install Brew](https://brew.sh/). Then run the following command(s):

```shell
brew bundle
```

The last command will run for a while. It runs all Mac OSX defaults along with other configurations - be patient. ðŸ©µ
